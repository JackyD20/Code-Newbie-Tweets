        <p>I created this project as a way to practice querying an API, storying information from that API in a database, and creating a new <a href="/api/tweets">API endpoint</a> serving up information from my database. Along the way, I also wanted to practice front-end and design skills.</p>
        <p>I used code newbie tweets  for the project because I love the code newbie community!
